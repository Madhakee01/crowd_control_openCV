# crowd_control_openCV
A tool for crowd control and writing codes that analyze a video and detect how many people are present in the scene. 

To the program...

1. clone this github repo using "git clone https://github.com/Madhakee01/crowd_control_openCV.git"

Then install the necessary dependencies and modules...

2. pip intall -r requirements.txt

Now you can run the program using "python Crowd_People_Counter.py". When you run the application a frame should be loaded with the video, and the program will start analyzing the video and count the number of people. 

Note: if you want to try with other videos, change this line cap = cv.VideoCapture('crowd.mp4') to the video file of your interest in "Crowd_People_Counter.py".
